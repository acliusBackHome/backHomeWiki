# Programming with C++

> University CS/SE C++ Course

## Characteristic of Object-Oriented Programming
* Everything is an object: data + operation
* Messages
* Object: just an instance of a class ( type )
* Iheritance

## Class
Describes a set of objects that have identical chararcteristics ( data elements ) and behaviors ( functionality ).

## Hide the Implementation
* Revise of implementation impacts nothing to client programmers.
* Data member protection: reduce program bugs.
* For client programmers: what they can use, not the details of the class.
* Access control: public, protected, private.

## Composition
Place an object of an existing class inside a new class.

Advantage: member objects an be changed at runtime.

## Inheritance
Similar funcitonality. Clone, make modification.

## Polymorphism
* Early binding
* Late binding
* Virtual function
* Polymorphism
